# UPS-Lite

I like the (rewritten) script a lot, but it doesn't give much information. I also have a rpi 3b+ with a PiCO UPS, for which a nice python-script is written with lots of useful information. This is my attempt to add some features to UPS-Lite.py... :)

## Information I like
as said: I'm spoiled with the output of pico_status.py:
